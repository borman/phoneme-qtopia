Classes that implement the Mobile Internationalization API.

The API provides the locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers 
(including percentages) and currency amounts. It is also possible to construct 
messages that have a variable number of ordered parameters.
Furthermore, the API defines a mechanism to retrieve application-specific and 
device-specific resources, and provides services for the locale-specific 
collation (sorting) of strings.
