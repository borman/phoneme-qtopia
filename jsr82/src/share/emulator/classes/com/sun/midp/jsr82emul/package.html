  <BODY>
    JSR 82 emulation part used in J2ME environment.
    
    This package is not a part of JSR 82 implementation and is only
    used within JSR 82 emulation mode.  The emulation mode allows 
    running tests without real native Bluetooth libraries or hardware.
    <p>
    JSR 82 porting layer is a set of native methods that invoke 
    native and hardware functions in the real implementation. 
    In the emulation mode the porting layer calls functionality 
    implemented in this package.
    <p>
    <i>JSR 82 Emulation</i> consists of a number of <i>emulation clients</i>
    and an <i>emulation server</i>. At runtime it is assumed that  server 
    runs somewhere on the Internet in J2SE environment and provides server 
    sockets for connections. A client runs under J2ME VM control and 
    represents Bluetooth local or remote device, connection or anything 
    else that requires Bluetooth ether communication. Server in turn 
    represents Bluetooth ether.
    <p>
    This package contains clients implementations and related 
    functionality.
