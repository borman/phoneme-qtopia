    OBEX over IrDA (irdaobex) protocol implementation
    <p>
    irdaobex protocol is implemented in two Java classes, IrNativeConnection
    and IrNativeNotifier. .Native. prefix is used to identify that these classes
    are mostly implemented in native code, and are intended to use with
    non-emulation build. No corresponding implementation is available for
    emulation build at the moment.
    <p>
    The porting interface is defined in IrConnection.h header file. Most of the
    functions declared there need to be implemented accordingly during the
    porting. In some cases, ir_connect_complete() is not required, when the
    connection establishment is known to be synchronous.
