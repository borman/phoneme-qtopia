    <p>This is the optimized implementation for WMA 2.0, which provides
      classes that allow Java applications to access MMS functionality
      on a mobile device.</p>
    <p>
      This implementation provides its own <tt>Protocol.java</tt> that
      makes native calls to access the platform provided MMS functions.
    </p>
    <p>The classes in this package support the sending and receiving of MMS messages.
	The classes in this package,
	{@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.mms.Protocol Protocol},
	{@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.mms.MMSAddress MMSAddress} and
	{@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.mms.MultipartObject MultipartObject} define
	this implementation. <tt>MultipartObject</tt> extends <tt>MessageObject</tt>
        and implements a MMS message. <tt>MMSAddress</tt> provides MMS address
        parsing and validation.
    </p> 
    <h3>Connection and Message Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>Connections can be made in server mode or in client mode.
	In server mode, messages can be sent or received. In client mode, messages
	can be sent only. Applications can treat
	sending and receiving independently. </p>

    <p>To receive messages, the application can open the connection by passing
	a string containing an "application ID" to the <tt>Connector.open</tt> method. A
	<tt>MessageConnection</tt> object is returned, on which the message can be
	received. If there are no messages in the queue, the <tt>receive()</tt>
	method will block until one arrives. When a message has been received,
	methods are available in the <tt>MessageObject</tt> class for retrieving
	its address and data parts. Calling the <tt>close()</tt> method closes the
	connection.</p>

    <p>To send messages, the application will either obtain an existing
	<tt>Message</tt> object or use the <tt>newMessage</tt> factory method to
	create one. If the application creates a <tt>Message</tt> object,
	methods are available in the <tt>MultipartObject</tt> class for setting
	its address and data
	parts. The application can open a connection by passing a string containing
	a fully-qualified MMS URL address to the
	<tt>Connector.open</tt> method. A <tt>MessageConnection</tt>
	object is returned, on which the message can be sent. Calling the
	<tt>close()</tt> method closes the connection.</p>
