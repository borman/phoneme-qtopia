<p>This package provides the payment application programming interface.
This application programming interface has been designed to allow for
an asynchronous handling of payment transactions. This is achieved by
an emit/notify mechanism, respectively represented by the
<code>TransactionModule</code> class and <code>TransactionListener</code>
interface.</p>
It is also part of the design that no basic <code>TransactionException
</code> class has been specified. Thereby it is avoided that an
application developer uses a general <code>catch(TransactionException)</code>
to (not) handle all payment related exceptions. It is also part of the
design that the developer must set a listener for transaction
notifications. In the case this is omitted, a <code>TransactionListenerException</code>
is thrown where
appropriate.
<h2>Design</h2>
The following UML diagram details the previously defined classes and
interfaces and shows also the interaction between those classes:<br>
